# Numbers.js
🔍 Overview

This project is a simple JavaScript-based number checker that analyzes user input and determines whether the number is even or odd, and positive or negative. It also includes a validation loop that ensures the user enters a valid number before processing.

🚀 Features

Input validation using isNaN(). Detection of:

Even or odd numbers;
Positive, negative, or zero;
Clean loop structure for user-friendly interaction;
Lightweight and easy to integrate into any webpage;

🧠 How It Works

The program prompts the user for a value. A loop checks if the input is a valid number. Once validated, the script analyzes the number and displays the result using alert().

▶️ Usage

Simply open index.html in any browser. Ensure that script.js is in the same directory so the script loads correctly.
